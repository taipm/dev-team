## Problem Statement

**Bug xuất hiện sau deploy**

## Analysis Chain

### Why #1

**A:** But the user's problem is to answer the question "Tại sao '.

### Why #2

**A:** <think> Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking why a bug occurred after deployment. The history shows Why #1: But the user's problem is to answer the question "Tại sao '.' xảy ra?" The answer needs to be concise, in Vietnamese, and follow the 5-Why rules. First, the problem is that the bug appeared after deployment. The user's question is about why the dot (.) is causing the issue. The answer should be the direct root cause. The example given uses  for the final root cause. In the history, the first Why is that the user's problem is to answer why the dot is causing the issue. But the actual root cause might be something else. Since the user's problem is about the bug, the answer should point to the actual reason. If the original problem was about the dot, maybe the root cause is a missing validation or a code error. But since the user's question is about the bug, the answer might be that the bug was due to a missing code check. However, the example given uses  for the final root cause. So if the direct cause is the missing code review, then the answer would be that. But the user's problem is about the bug, so the answer should be the direct reason. Wait, the user's problem is to answer why the dot is causing the issue. The answer should be the direct cause. If the dot is part of the bug, maybe the root cause is a missing check. But the example shows  for the final root cause. So the answer here would be that the bug was due to a missing code review. But the user's problem is about the bug, so the answer should be the direct cause. Let me check the example again: the example answer is  Thiếu quy trình code review bắt buộc. So the answer here would be that the bug occurred because of a missing code review step. Therefore, the answer is that the bug occurred because of a missing code review step, so the direct cause is the missing code review. Hence, the answer should be: "Do thiếu quy trình code review trước khi deploy." And if that's the root cause, then  Thiếu quy trình code review bắt buộc. Do thiếu quy trình code review trước khi deploy.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Address root cause directly
2. **Prevention:** Implement safeguards
3. **Verify:** Test solution resolves original problem
