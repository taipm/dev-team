**Website load chậm**

## Analysis Chain

### Why #1

**A:** <think> Okay, the user is asking why the website loads slowly. The answer needs to be concise, in Vietnamese, and follow the 5-Why rules. Let me think. First, the problem is the website loading slowly. The first reason could be technical issues. Maybe the server is overloaded. But the user wants the direct cause. So, if the server is too slow, maybe because of high traffic. But the answer should be short. Let me check the example given. The example had "Thiếu quy trình code review bắt buộc" as the direct cause. So here, the answer should be something like "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." But the user wants the answer in one sentence, concise. So maybe "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." But the example shows that the answer is in the form of the direct cause, which is "Thiếu quy trình code review bắt buộc." So here, the direct cause is "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." But the user's example has the root cause in brackets. So the answer should be the direct cause, not the root cause. So the answer is "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." But the user wants the answer in one sentence, so that's it. Then, if that's the root cause, start with . But the user's example shows that the answer is the direct cause, not the root cause. So the answer here is "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." But the user's example has the root cause in brackets. So maybe the answer is just the direct cause, not the root cause. So the answer is "Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao." Do server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao.
