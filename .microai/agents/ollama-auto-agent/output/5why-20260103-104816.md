## Problem Statement

**Website load chậm**

## Analysis Chain

### Why #1

**A:** Vì server quá tải do lượng truy cập cao.

### Why #2

**A:** <think> Okay, let's see. The user is asking why the website is loading slowly. The initial analysis says it's because the server is overloaded due to high traffic. The question is asking why that happened. So, the direct cause would be the server being overloaded. But the user wants the answer in Vietnamese, short, and to the point. They also mentioned if it's the root cause, start with . The example given was similar, so I need to follow that structure. The problem statement says the website loads slowly, and the first why is server overload due to high traffic. The user's question is asking why that reason happened. So the answer should be the underlying cause. In the example, they used  for the lack of code review. So here, the root cause would be the lack of proper server capacity planning or resource allocation. But the user's history shows that the first why is server overload, so maybe the root cause is the lack of capacity planning. But the user's example had  for the code review issue. So maybe the answer is  lack of capacity planning. But the user's example had the root cause as the lack of code review, which is a process step. So in this case, the root cause would be the lack of proper server capacity planning. But the user's first why is server overload due to high traffic. So the answer should be the root cause, which is the lack of capacity planning. So the answer would be  Thiếu kế hoạch phân bổ tài nguyên server. But the user's example had  for the code review, so maybe the answer should be  Thiếu kiểm tra code trước khi deploy. But in this case, the root cause is the lack of capacity planning. So the answer is  Thiếu kế hoạch phân bổ tài nguyên server. But the user's first why is server overload due to high traffic. So the answer is the root cause, which is the lack of capacity planning. So the answer should be  Thiếu kế hoạch phân bổ tài nguyên server.  Thiếu kế hoạch phân bổ tài nguyên server.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Address root cause directly
2. **Prevention:** Implement safeguards
3. **Verify:** Test solution resolves original problem
