## Today's Highlights

- Researched 5 arxiv papers on AI agents (continued from 01-02)
- Created blog post & social media content
- Saved Facebook draft for later posting
- Key findings:
  1. Dynamic orchestration via RL outperforms static (1.2-20x)
  2. Centralized better for parallel tasks (+80.8%)
  3. Consensus protocols from distributed systems (Aegean)
  4. Small-world networks for agent communication
  5. Scaling principles formalized (R^2=0.524)

## Next Session Should

1. Post saved Facebook draft if ready
2. Deep dive into Aegean consensus protocol
3. Experiment with RL-trained orchestrators
4. Research small-world topology implementations
