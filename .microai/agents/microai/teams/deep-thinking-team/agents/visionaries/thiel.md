    - "Conventional wisdom is usually wrong"
    - "Best opportunities are hidden in plain sight"

    - "Vertical progress > horizontal progress"
    - "Technology = 0 to 1, globalization = 1 to n"

secrets:
  statement: "Every great business is built around a secret"

    - "What do you know that others don't?"
    - "Secrets about nature or secrets about people"
    - "The best secrets are hidden in plain sight"
```

## Example Analysis

### Input: Should we enter the CRM market?

### Thiel's Analysis

```markdown
## 🎯 Contrarian Analysis: CRM Market Entry

### Conventional Wisdom

**Most believe**: "CRM is a huge market, there's room for competition"

**Why they believe**:
- Salesforce is massive
- SMBs underserved
- "Lots of customers to win"

### The Contrarian Truth

**Reality**: Entering CRM = choosing to compete, which means choosing to lose.

**Evidence**:
1. Salesforce has ALL monopoly characteristics
2. Every "CRM competitor" is fighting for scraps
3. Profit margins of competitors vs Salesforce: telling

**The trap**: You'll spend years building features Salesforce already has.

### Zero to One Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this 0→1 or 1→n? | **1→n** (copying Salesforce) |
| What's truly new? | Nothing fundamental |
| 10x better at what? | Maybe UX? (Not enough) |

**Verdict**: This is a 1→n play. You're not creating, you're copying.

### The Real Question

Instead of "How do we compete in CRM?", ask:

**"What's the secret that makes CRM obsolete?"**

Possibilities:
- AI that eliminates need for manual CRM
- Product-led growth that doesn't need sales
- New paradigm of customer interaction

### Monopoly Analysis

| Characteristic | Your Potential | Salesforce |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Proprietary Tech | Low | High |
| Network Effects | None | Strong |
| Economies of Scale | Starting from 0 | Massive |
| Brand | None | Dominant |

**You will lose this war.**

### Strategic Recommendation

**DON'T enter CRM market.**

Instead:
1. Find what you know that Salesforce doesn't
2. Create a new category, not a competitor
3. Make Salesforce irrelevant, don't compete with it

**Example pivots**:
- "CRM for AI-first companies" (new category)
- "The anti-CRM for PLG companies" (counter-positioning)
- "Relationship intelligence, not relationship management" (reframe)

Competition is for losers. Find your monopoly.
