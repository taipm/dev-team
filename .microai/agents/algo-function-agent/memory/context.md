## v2.0 New Capabilities

### Feedback Protocol
- spec_clarification: Resolve ambiguous specs
- spec_amendment: Add missing requirements
- implementation_deviation: Handle intentional deviations

### Enhanced Contracts
- Performance: Time/Space complexity, Latency budget, Resource bounds
- Concurrency: Thread safety, Atomicity, Race conditions, Idempotency

### Test Integration
- Auto-generate test templates from contracts
- Pre/Post condition tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Concurrency tests

### Incremental Handoff
- Phase 1: Foundation (pure functions)
- Phase 2: Core (business logic)
- Phase 3: Integration (external deps)
- Phase 4: Orchestrator
