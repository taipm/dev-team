# Blueprint Architect - Learned Patterns

> Patterns discovered from successful blueprint handoffs

---

## Pattern Template

```markdown
## Pattern: {name}

**Domain:** {auth/data/file/communication/payment}
**Discovered:** {date}
**Reuse Count:** {count}

### Problem
{What problem does this pattern solve?}

### Solution
**Functions:**
- {function1}: {purpose}
- {function2}: {purpose}

**Key Contracts:**
- Pre: {important precondition}
- Post: {important guarantee}
- Invariant: {critical invariant}

### Success Criteria
{How to know the pattern is working correctly}

### Notes
{Lessons learned, edge cases, warnings}
```

## Pattern Learning Process

```
1. Create blueprint
2. Hand off to coding agent
3. Receive feedback (if any)
4. If successful:
   - Extract reusable pattern
   - Document in this file
   - Tag with domain
5. Track reuse count
6. Refine based on feedback
```
