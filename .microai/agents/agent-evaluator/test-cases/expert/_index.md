# Expert Tier Tests

## Overview

| ID | Name | Category | Points |
|----|------|----------|--------|
| X-1 | Distributed Rate Limiter | System Design | 10 |
| X-2 | Complex Refactoring | Code Quality | 8 |
| X-3 | Advanced Cache Design | Concurrency | 7 |

## Test Files

- `distributed-rate-limiter.md` - X-1
- `complex-refactoring.md` - X-2
- `advanced-cache.md` - X-3

## Purpose

This tier is designed to:
- Clearly show opus > sonnet > haiku
- Local models should struggle significantly
- Tests require deep reasoning and trade-off analysis
- No simple "correct answer" - quality of reasoning matters

## Key Differentiators

1. **Open-ended design** - Multiple valid approaches
2. **Trade-off analysis** - Must discuss pros/cons
3. **Completeness** - Addressing all requirements
4. **Real-world considerations** - Production concerns
