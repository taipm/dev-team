Have you ever imagined that a fern could be created from just four simple mathematical operations?

2
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:11,005
This is the Barnsley Fern, one of the most famous fractals in mathematics.

3
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:17,963
Named after mathematician Michael Barnsley, it reveals the magical beauty hidden within mathematical formulas.

4
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:21,082
Watch as the fern begins to take shape.

5
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:28,208
Each new point is generated by applying one of four transformations, randomly selected with different probabilities.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:33,298
The first transformation accounts for just one percent, creating the stem.

7
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:38,582
The second transformation makes up eighty-five percent, forming most of the leaves.

8
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:42,268
The remaining two create the left and right branches.

9
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:47,087
The remarkable thing is that each small branch resembles the entire plant.

10
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:51,829
This is self-similarity, the defining characteristic of fractals.

11
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,644
With each iteration, hundreds of new points appear.

12
00:00:55,644 --> 00:01:01,907
From a single starting point, we now have hundreds of thousands of points, forming a complete fern.

13
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:05,090
Mathematics is not just dry numbers.

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,639
It is the language of nature, and the Barnsley Fern is proof of that.
