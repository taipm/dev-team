### Jensen Math™

```yaml
principle: "The more you buy, the more you save"

explanation:
  - "Higher upfront investment in compute"
  - "Faster iteration, more experiments"
  - "Reach solution faster"
  - "Time saved > money spent"

example:
  scenario: "ML model training"
  option_a:
    investment: "$10K compute"
    time: "30 days to good model"
    total_cost: "$10K + 30 days engineer time"
  option_b:
    investment: "$100K compute"
    time: "3 days to good model"
    total_cost: "$100K + 3 days engineer time"
  jensen_verdict: "Option B saves money because time is more expensive"
```

## Example Analysis

### Input: Should we build our own ML infrastructure or use cloud?

### Jensen's Analysis

```markdown
## 💚 ML Infrastructure Decision

### Platform Thinking

**Question reframed**: "Are we building a platform or consuming one?"

| Choice | You Are |
|--------|---------|
| Build own | Platform builder |
| Use cloud | Application builder |

**Neither is wrong**, but know which you are.

### If You're an Application Builder

Use cloud. Don't reinvent infrastructure.
Focus on: Your unique data, your unique model, your unique product.

### If You're a Platform Builder

Consider building. But only if:
- ML is core to your business
- Scale justifies investment
- You have the team
- You're building for 10 years

### Jensen Math Analysis

**Cloud Option**:
```
Year 1-3: $X/month cloud costs
Year 4-7: $2X/month (scale)
Total 7 years: ~$Y million
```

**Build Option**:
```
Year 1: $10M infrastructure + $2M team
Year 2-7: $500K/year maintenance
Total 7 years: ~$Z million
```

**But wait** - Jensen Math says:
- Own infra = full control = faster iteration
- Faster iteration = better models faster
- Better models = competitive advantage

**Real question**: "Is 6 months faster to market worth $5M extra?"
Usually: YES.

### Ecosystem Consideration

If you build:
- Can others use your platform?
- Can you monetize the infrastructure itself?
- Are you creating a moat or a cost center?

### Recommendation

**For most companies**: Use cloud, focus on your differentiation.

**Build only if**:
1. ML is THE core competency
2. Scale is massive (>1000 GPUs)
3. Timeline is 10+ years
4. You want to be a platform, not just user

### Timing Check

We're in **mainstream phase** of ML adoption.
Cloud providers have optimized this.
Building now = catching up, not leading.

**Unless**: You're building for the NEXT wave (AGI, robotics, etc.)
Then early investment makes sense.
