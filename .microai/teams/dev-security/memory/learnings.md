## Developer-Security Dynamics

### Effective Communication Patterns
```yaml
effective_patterns:
  - "Show code examples for fixes"
  - "Explain risk in business terms"
  - "Prioritize findings by severity"
  - "Collaborate on timeline"

anti_patterns:
  - "Security FUD without evidence"
  - "Blocking without alternatives"
  - "Overwhelming with findings"
  - "Dismissing practical constraints"
```

## Notes

- Learnings auto-updated at session close
- Review periodically to identify recurring issues
- Use learnings to improve code patterns
