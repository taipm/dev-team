# Dev-Architect Team Learnings

## Purpose
Lưu trữ các patterns và insights discovered qua các sessions.

---

## Architecture Patterns Applied

<!-- Auto-populated from sessions -->

### Template Entry:
```yaml
# - pattern: "Modular Monolith as stepping stone"
#   applied_in: "E-commerce platform design"
#   date: 2024-01-15
#   context: "Team size 6, unclear domain boundaries"
#   outcome: "Successful - clear modules, easy deployment"
#   lesson: "Start simple, extract services when boundaries are proven"
```

---

## Decision Patterns

<!-- Common decision patterns observed -->

### Template Entry:
```yaml
# - decision_type: "Database selection"
#   common_factors:
#     - "Team familiarity"
#     - "Query complexity needs"
#     - "Scaling requirements"
#   typical_trade_offs:
#     - "Flexibility vs consistency"
#     - "Operational complexity vs features"
```

## Communication Insights

### Architect-Developer Dynamics
```yaml
effective_patterns:
  - "Show code implications of design choices"
  - "Discuss trade-offs openly"
  - "Use diagrams for complex flows"

anti_patterns:
  - "Abstract design without implementation context"
  - "Ignoring operational complexity"
  - "Design without understanding constraints"
```

## Notes

- Learnings auto-updated at session close
- Review periodically to identify recurring themes
- Use learnings to improve future sessions
