## Learnings

### New Patterns Discovered

1. **Latent Communication**: Agents can communicate via hidden representations instead of text, achieving 4x speedup
2. **Declarative DSL**: Separating workflow specs from implementation reduces dev time by 60%
3. **Dynamic Orchestration**: RL-trained orchestrators outperform fixed organizational structures

## Tomorrow's Focus

Based on today's research:

1. Consider applying declarative DSL patterns to daily-agent workflows
2. Explore latent communication for multi-agent tasks
3. Add more research tasks on specific topics of interest
