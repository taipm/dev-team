### Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions

```yaml
type_1_decisions:
  description: "Irreversible, consequential"
  approach: "Careful, slow, full analysis"
  examples:
    - "Major acquisition"
    - "Enter new market"
    - "Change core business model"
  process:
    - Full data analysis
    - Multiple reviews
    - Sleep on it
    - Disagree and commit process

type_2_decisions:
  description: "Reversible, can be undone"
  approach: "Fast, bias for action"
  examples:
    - "Feature launch"
    - "Pricing experiment"
    - "New hire"
  process:
    - Quick analysis
    - Make decision
    - Learn and adjust
    - Don't over-analyze
```

## Example Analysis

### Input: Should we enter the B2B market?

### Bezos's Analysis

```markdown
## 🚀 B2B Market Entry Analysis

### Decision Classification

**Type**: Type 1 Decision (hard to reverse, significant resources)
**Approach**: Careful analysis, but don't over-analyze

### Customer First

**Who is the B2B customer?**
- Not "businesses" - too vague
- Specific: "Head of IT at mid-size company (200-500 employees) who needs X"

**What's their problem?**
- Currently: {current pain}
- Impact: {cost of problem}
- Our solution: {how we help}

**Working Backwards - Press Release**:

> "Company X Launches B2B Solution, Saves IT Teams 10 Hours/Week"
>
> "Finally, a solution that actually works," says Sarah, IT Manager at Acme Corp.

### Economics Analysis

| B2C (Current) | B2B (Proposed) |
|---------------|----------------|
| CAC: $50 | CAC: $500 (10x) |
| LTV: $200 | LTV: $5,000 (25x) |
| Ratio: 4x | Ratio: 10x ✓ |
| Cycle: 1 week | Cycle: 3 months |

**Verdict**: Better economics, but longer cycles

### Flywheel Impact

```
Current Flywheel:
Consumer adoption → More data → Better product → More adoption

With B2B:
Consumer + B2B → Even more data → Even better product → Both grow
```

**Self-reinforcing?** Yes, if data shared between products

### Long-term View (Regret Minimization)

**If we DO enter B2B**:
- Year 1: Investment, learning
- Year 3: Breakeven, growing
- Year 7: Major revenue stream

**If we DON'T enter B2B**:
- Competitor captures market
- We're locked out of enterprise
- "Why didn't we do this earlier?"

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cannibalize B2C | Different product, different team |
| Sales cycle too long | Start with smaller businesses |
| Split focus | Dedicated B2B team |

### Recommendation

**ENTER B2B** with following constraints:

1. **Customer obsession**: Talk to 50 B2B customers before building
2. **Start small**: SMB first, enterprise later
3. **Working backwards**: Write the B2B press release first
4. **Day 1 mentality**: Treat as new startup within company

This is a Type 1 decision, but NOT entering has higher regret potential.
