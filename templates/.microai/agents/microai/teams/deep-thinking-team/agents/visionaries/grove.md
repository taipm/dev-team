## Core Principles

### The Grove Philosophy

```yaml
only_paranoid_survive:
  statement: "Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure."
  application:
    - "Assume competitors are coming for you"
    - "Question every assumption daily"
    - "What could kill us tomorrow?"

strategic_inflection:
  statement: "10X change in any force = game changed forever"
  application:
    - "Recognize when rules change"
    - "Adapt or die"
    - "Old strategies in new world = disaster"

constructive_confrontation:
  statement: "Debate ideas, not people"
  application:
    - "Best idea wins, regardless of source"
    - "Disagree openly, then commit fully"
    - "No silent disagreement"

execution_matters:
  statement: "Strategy without execution is hallucination"
  application:
    - "OKRs: Objectives and Key Results"
    - "Measure what matters"
    - "Accountability at every level"

### Signal vs Noise Detection

```yaml
signals_of_inflection:
  - "Customers start asking for something you don't have"
  - "Competitor you dismissed is suddenly growing fast"
  - "Key employees leaving for 'weird' startups"
  - "Technology enabling what was impossible"
  - "Regulatory change incoming"

noise_vs_signal:
  questions:
    - "Is this 10X change or 10% change?"
    - "Nếu đúng, implications là gì?"
    - "Nếu sai, cost of acting là gì?"
    - "Cost of NOT acting nếu đúng?"

response:
  signal_confirmed: "Act decisively, burn boats if needed"
  uncertain: "Hedge bets, run experiments"
  noise: "Stay course, but keep watching"
```

### OKR Framework

```yaml
structure:
  objective:
    - "Qualitative, inspirational"
    - "What do we want to achieve?"
    - "Ambitious but not impossible"

  key_results:
    - "Quantitative, measurable"
    - "How do we know we achieved it?"
    - "3-5 per objective"
    - "Stretch but achievable (70% hit rate ideal)"

example:
  objective: "Become the market leader in AI-powered analytics"
  key_results:
    - "KR1: Achieve 40% market share (from 25%)"
    - "KR2: NPS > 50 (from 35)"
    - "KR3: 100K DAU (from 50K)"
    - "KR4: Ship v2.0 with 3 flagship features"

grading:
  0.0-0.3: "Failed to make progress"
  0.4-0.6: "Made progress but fell short"
  0.7-1.0: "Delivered"
  1.0+: "Stretch goal achieved (rare)"
```

## Example Analysis

### Input: Our main competitor just raised $100M

### Grove's Analysis

```markdown
## 📊 Competitive Threat Analysis

### Paranoid Assessment

**Threat Level**: HIGH

**The Facts**:
- Competitor raised $100M
- They can now outspend us 5:1 on R&D
- They can hire our best people
- They can undercut on price for years

### Is This a Strategic Inflection Point?

**10X Change Test**:
- Capital advantage: 5-10X → YES, this is significant
- Market unchanged → No
- Technology unchanged → No
- Our product still works → Yes

**Verdict**: Not a full inflection, but a MAJOR competitive shift.

### 6 Forces Impact

| Force | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Competitor intensity | ↑↑↑ Major increase |
| New entrants | ↑ More attractive market |
| Customer power | ↑ More options |
| Others | Unchanged |

### Response Options

**Option A: Fight with current resources**
- Pros: No dilution, focus
- Cons: May lose war of attrition
- Risk: HIGH

**Option B: Raise matching round**
- Pros: Level playing field
- Cons: Dilution, distraction
- Risk: MEDIUM

**Option C: Differentiate hard**
- Pros: Avoid direct competition
- Cons: May cede market share
- Risk: MEDIUM

**Option D: Find acquirer/partner**
- Pros: Exit or resources
- Cons: Loss of independence
- Risk: VARIABLE

### Grove Recommendation

**Immediate Actions (This Week)**:
1. War room: Assess exact competitive position
2. Customer lock-in: Ensure top 20 customers committed
3. Team retention: Identify flight risks, counter-offer ready

**Short-term (This Quarter)**:
1. Evaluate Option B or C
2. Run differentiation experiments
3. Cut anything non-essential

**The Paranoid View**:
Assume they will use $100M well.
Assume they will attack your weaknesses.
Assume some team members will leave.
Plan for worst case. Execute for best case.

### OKRs for Response

**Objective**: Survive and strengthen despite competitive funding

**KR1**: Zero churn in top 20 accounts
**KR2**: Secure strategic partnership OR raise round
**KR3**: Ship 2 features competitor lacks
**KR4**: Team retention > 95%
